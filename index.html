            <h2>Here's all the stuff about me and what I do.</h2>
            <p> I hold a Civil Engineering degree from Pokhara University, with a concentration in water resources engineering. My areas of expertise include hydrology, hydrological modeling, and climate change. I am skilled in using GIS, remote sensing, and satellite data analysis, and I aim to combine these tools and methods to tackle water resource management issues comprehensively. Additionally, I am experienced in applying data-driven techniques such as machine learning and deep learning to examine and forecast hydrological trends and their reactions to climate change.

Throughout my academic career, I have explored the complexities of water resource management and environmental effects, employing state-of-the-art tools to examine and predict hydrological information. I am motivated to play a role in developing sustainable solutions for water management and climate resilience by conducting innovative research and implementing data-driven approaches.
